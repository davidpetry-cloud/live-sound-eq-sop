/**
 * Attestation engine
 *
 * A value in an operating procedure is not a fact. It is an assertion made by

 * explicit and enforces one rule above all others:
 *
 *   A model can propose. Only a named human can attest.
 *
 * Status is derived, never stored. Storing it would let a stale record claim
 * to be current; deriving it from the verification date means a value decays
 * on its own unless somebody re-checks it in a real room.

 *      as merely "proposed" and the reviewer's judgement would vanish.
 *   2. Model records next. No combination of fields can promote a model
 *      assertion past this line.
 *   3. Everything else resolves on the verification date.
 *
 * A rejection does not decay. It stands until somebody supersedes it by
 * attesting a replacement value, which records the rejection in `supersedes`.
